Podlist is an application that helps you create and share podcast playlists. This was a two week individual project that focused on using APIs. I used the Audiosear.ch API to allow users to create and share podcast playlists. You can also listen to the podcast episodes directly from the page and see shows related to the ones you're checking out.

The production version can be found here:
